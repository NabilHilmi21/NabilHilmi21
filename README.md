**Hello (●'◡'●), welcome to my GitHub profile!**

This is where I share my coding journey, mini (and hopefully big) projects, and other coding-related things. Right now, I’m mainly focused on web development, with the goal of building a fully dynamic website!

**Thanks for stopping by! ☆: .｡. o(≧▽≦)o .｡.:☆**
